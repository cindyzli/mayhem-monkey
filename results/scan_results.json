      "title": "SQL Injection in Search Functionality",
      "severity": "critical",
      "category": "SQL Injection",
      "details": {
        "description": "The search functionality on the /search page is vulnerable to SQL injection. Submitting a single quote (') as the search query caused the application to return a detailed database error page, confirming the vulnerability.",
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to read, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially leading to a full compromise of the application and its data.",
        "recommendation": "Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions involving user-supplied input. This will ensure that user input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code.",
        "codeSnippet": "POST /search\n\nquery='"
